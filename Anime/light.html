            Light Yagami (Japanese: 夜神月ライト, Hepburn: Yagami Raito) is a fictional character in the manga series Death Note, created by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. He is portrayed as a brilliant but bored genius who finds the Death Note, an otherworldly supernatural
            notebook that allows the user to kill anyone by knowing their name and face, after it is dropped by the Shinigami Ryuk. Frustrated by the status quo of a world he deems to be rotten, Light uses the Death Note to kill those whom he deems morally
            unworthy of life, masterminding a worldwide massacre as the vigilante Kira (キラ). Over the course of his efforts to become the god of a world free of crime, Light is hunted down by a special task-force, headed by an enigmatic consulting detective
            known as L.
