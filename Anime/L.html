            L Lawliet (Japanese: エル・ローライト, Hepburn: Eru Rōraito),known mononymously as L, is a fictional character in the manga series Death Note, created by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. He is an enigmatic, mysterious and highly-esteemed international consulting
            detective, who communicates with law enforcement agencies only through his equally inexplicable handler/assistant, Watari, who serves as his official liaison with the authorities and whose true identity and background is kept a secret. Though
            his past is shrouded in mystery, he has gained an arguable reputation as the world's greatest detective/criminal profiler and becoming an antihero.
